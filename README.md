# Hunting

Executes your main attack automatically until target is gone.

BashOn / BashOff turns this reflex on and off. When bashing is on simply attack a target, then the reflex will continue to attack until the target is gone.

bash <type> is optional for hunting multiple targets. For example bash buckawn, will hit a target until gone and then move to target a new buckawn until all buckawn's are gone from the room.
   
Battle rage is not automatically performed. A shield warning will display in red when.

Some events/afflictions will stop the reflex from attacking automatically, and a manual attack may need to be performed to begin attacking again.
